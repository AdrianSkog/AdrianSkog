<h1 style="background-color:violet;">why jojo's bizarre adventures is good</h1>
<p style="color:slateblue;"> i like jojo's bizarre adventures because of the weird but yet funny characters and speaking of characters the character development is pretty good too i also like is that each of the joestars/cujoh family get to have their own adventures with their companions and wether it would be vampires or stands they are fighting it's still going to be just as exiting</p>
